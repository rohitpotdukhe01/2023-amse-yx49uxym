# Project Plan

## Summary

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 5 sentences. -->
This project describes the long term bicycle traffic trends such as,
1. Has there been an overall increase or decrease in bicycle traffic volume in Cologne over the years?
2. Can we identify any seasonal patterns or fluctuations in bicycle traffic volume across different years?
3. Are there any specific years that show significant changes in bicycle traffic volume?

## Rationale

<!-- Outline the impact of the analysis, e.g. which pains it solves. -->
This analysis can provide insights into popular cycling routes and intersections, helping planners identify areas where additional safety measures, such as dedicated bike lanes or traffic calming measures, are necessary.

## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->
